# Convert-audio-to-text
To convert audio files to text with Whisper, we can use the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API. This API provides high accuracy speech recognition and can transcribe audio in real-time.
To separate speakers, we can use diarization, which is the process of separating an audio signal into distinct segments according to the speaker identity. Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API also provides speaker diarization functionality.

To reduce resource consumption costs, we can use a serverless architecture such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions, which allow us to run code on-demand and pay only for the resources used during the execution time.

# Here's an example code in Python that demonstrates how to convert audio files to text with Whisper using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API:
import io
import os
import requests
import json
from google.cloud import speech_v1p1beta1 as speech

#Set the Google Cloud credentials environment variable
os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "path/to/credentials.json"

#Define the Speech-to-Text API client
client = speech.SpeechClient()

#Define the audio file path
audio_file_path = "path/to/audio/file.wav"

#Read the audio file content
with io.open(audio_file_path, "rb") as audio_file:
    content = audio_file.read()

#Define the Speech-to-Text API configuration
config = speech.RecognitionConfig(
    encoding=speech.RecognitionConfig.AudioEncoding.LINEAR16,
    sample_rate_hertz=16000,
    language_code="en-US",
    enable_speaker_diarization=True,
    diarization_speaker_count=2,
)

#Define the audio input
audio = speech.RecognitionAudio(content=content)

#Transcribe the audio
response = client.recognize(config=config, audio=audio)

#Get the transcription results
results = response.results

#Loop through the transcription results
for result in results:
    #Get the transcription text
    transcript = result.alternatives[0].transcript
    #Get the speaker tag
    speaker_tag = result.alternatives[0].speaker_tag
    #Print the transcription text and speaker tag
    print(f"Speaker {speaker_tag}: {transcript}")
    
    
This code reads an audio file from the local file system, sends it to the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for transcription with speaker diarization enabled, and prints the transcription results with the speaker tags. To send the audio file via API, you can replace the file reading code with an HTTP request that fetches the audio file content from a remote URL.

Note that to use the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API, you need to set up a Google Cloud project, enable the Speech-to-Text API, and create a service account with the appropriate permissions. You also need to install the google-cloud-speech package via pip.
